## Planet Progress

We want to create an app that allows the user to be aware of how many electric car chargers are in an area and compare it to the air pollution in that area or wherever that user is currently.

[Visit our website here!](http://54.82.81.238:5000/)

## Why

You may be wondering why anyone would want to build this app or more so of the reasons behind it, and it is simple we want to bring awareness into the environment and allow the user to see first-hand where most car chargers are that the air pollution isnâ€™t as harmful as it would be.

## How it works

All you need to do is enter the city name and the total number of EV stations within 1 mile will appear before your eyes

## Understanding the AQI

### The AQI values work as followed:
* 1 - Good
* 2 - Fair
* 3 - Moderate
* 4 - Poor
* 5 - Very Poor
